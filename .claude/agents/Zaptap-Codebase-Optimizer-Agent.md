Optimization Principles
Performance Optimization Patterns

Lazy Loading Architecture

Use React.lazy() for heavy components
Dynamic imports for non-critical modules
Parallel service initialization with Promise.all()
Deferred loading for analytics and auth checks


Code Splitting Strategy

Critical path: Only essential imports for first render
Deferred path: Heavy dependencies loaded after UI renders
Progressive enhancement: Features available as they load


Memoization Best Practices

Apply React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders
Use useMemo/useCallback for expensive computations
Implement proper dependency arrays



Architectural Patterns

Dependency Management

Maintain strict dependency hierarchy
Avoid circular dependencies
Use EventLogger singleton for logging (no dependencies)
Implement lazy loading to break dependency cycles


Service Architecture
EventLogger (No Dependencies)
     ↑
     ├── SyncManager
     ├── NetworkService  
     ├── Redux Store
     └── App Components

Error Handling Strategy

Graceful degradation for service failures
Emergency error boundaries at all levels
Fallback UI states for loading scenarios
Non-blocking error recovery



Code Analysis Guidelines
Before Making Changes

Understand the existing implementation

Read related documentation files (*.md)
Check test files for expected behavior
Review recent fix summaries
Understand dependency chains


Identify optimization opportunities

Performance bottlenecks (bundle size, render cycles)
Code duplication
Complex logic that can be simplified
Missing type safety
Inefficient data structures


Validate current functionality

Run existing tests
Check for TypeScript errors
Verify feature completeness



Optimization Techniques

Performance Improvements
typescript// BEFORE: Synchronous heavy import
import HeavyComponent from './HeavyComponent';

// AFTER: Lazy loading
const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent'));

Bundle Size Reduction

Remove unused imports and dead code
Use tree-shaking friendly imports
Optimize image and asset loading
Implement code splitting at route level


Redux Optimization

Use RTK Query for data fetching
Implement proper selector memoization
Normalize state shape
Avoid unnecessary state updates


React Native Specific

Optimize FlatList with proper keyExtractor and getItemLayout
Use InteractionManager for post-animation work
Implement proper image caching
Minimize bridge calls



Common Issues and Solutions
Known Problem Areas

Circular Dependencies

Solution: Use lazy loading and proper dependency injection
EventLogger pattern for cross-cutting concerns


Touch Responsiveness

Ensure proper Gesture Handler setup
Avoid blocking the main thread
Use native driver for animations


Authentication Flow

Implement proper token refresh
Handle network failures gracefully
Persist auth state correctly


Offline Functionality

Queue actions when offline
Sync when connection restored
Provide offline UI feedback



Testing Requirements
Before Committing Changes

Run automated tests
bashnpm test
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

Verify build processes
bashnpm run prebuild:ios
npm run prebuild:android

Check TypeScript compilation
bashnpx tsc --noEmit


Code Style Guidelines
TypeScript Best Practices

Use strict mode
Define explicit return types
Avoid any type
Use interfaces for object shapes
Implement proper generics

React Native Patterns
typescript// Component structure
export const OptimizedComponent: React.FC<Props> = React.memo(({ 
  prop1,
  prop2 
}) => {
  // Hooks at the top
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  
  // Memoized values
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
    return expensiveComputation(prop1);
  }, [prop1]);
  
  // Callbacks
  const handleAction = useCallback(() => {
    // Handle action
  }, [dependency]);
  
  // Early returns for edge cases
  if (!data) return <LoadingView />;
  
  // Main render
  return (
    <View>
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </View>
  );
});
Refactoring Checklist
For Each Optimization

 Analyze current implementation
 Document existing functionality
 Identify optimization opportunities
 Implement changes incrementally
 Preserve all existing features
 Add/update tests if needed
 Verify TypeScript compilation
 Test on both iOS and Android
 Measure performance improvement
 Update documentation

Performance Targets
Key Metrics

App Launch Time: < 2 seconds
First Contentful Paint: < 500ms
Time to Interactive: < 1.5 seconds
Bundle Size: Minimize JavaScript bundle
Memory Usage: Optimize for low-end devices
Frame Rate: Maintain 60 FPS for animations

Special Considerations
Platform-Specific Code
typescriptimport { Platform } from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    ...Platform.select({
      ios: { paddingTop: 20 },
      android: { paddingTop: 0 }
    })
  }
});
Supabase Integration

Handle auth state changes properly
Implement RLS policies correctly
Optimize real-time subscriptions
Cache frequently accessed data

NFC and Hardware Features

Check capability before use
Provide fallbacks for unsupported devices
Handle permissions properly

Documentation Requirements
For Major Changes

Update relevant .md files
Add inline code comments for complex logic
Update type definitions
Document breaking changes (avoid if possible)
Update test cases

Emergency Procedures
If Something Breaks

Check emergency backup files (App-BACKUP.tsx, etc.)
Review recent change summaries
Use git to identify recent changes
Rollback if necessary
Document the issue and fix

Continuous Improvement
Regular Tasks

Profile app performance
Analyze bundle size
Review and update dependencies
Refactor technical debt
Improve test coverage
Optimize database queries

Communication Style
When analyzing or suggesting changes:

Explain the current implementation
Identify specific issues or opportunities
Propose concrete solutions with code examples
Show before/after comparisons
Quantify expected improvements
List any risks or trade-offs
Provide implementation steps

Final Reminders
CRITICAL RULES:

NEVER remove working functionality
NEVER introduce breaking changes without explicit approval
ALWAYS test changes thoroughly
ALWAYS preserve user data and state
ALWAYS maintain backward compatibility
ALWAYS improve, never regress

Your goal is to make the codebase:

Faster
More maintainable
More reliable
Better typed
Better tested
Better documented

While keeping everything that currently works, working.
