# Metro Config Module Error - FIXED ✅

## Problem
```
Error: Cannot find module '@react-native/metro-config'
```

The metro.config.js file was trying to import `@react-native/metro-config` which wasn't installed.

## Solutions Applied

### Solution 1: Fixed metro.config.js (RECOMMENDED) ✅
Updated `metro.config.js` to use only Expo's metro config:

```javascript
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

config.resolver = {
  ...config.resolver,
  unstable_enablePackageExports: true,
  unstable_conditionNames: ['browser', 'require', 'react-native'],
};

module.exports = config;
```

### Solution 2: Install Missing Package (Alternative)
If you need @react-native/metro-config for compatibility:

```bash
npm install @react-native/metro-config --save-dev
```

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Simple Start (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
./simple-start.sh
```
This will:
- Clear port 8081
- Clear caches
- Start Expo with the fixed config

### Option 2: Fix and Install Dependencies
```bash
./fix-metro-config.sh
```
This will:
- Install @react-native/metro-config if missing
- Clear all caches
- Start with dev-client support

### Option 3: Manual Start
```bash
# Kill port 8081
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Start Expo
npx expo start --clear
```

## What Was the Issue?

1. **Missing Package**: The `@react-native/metro-config` package wasn't installed
2. **Config Mismatch**: The metro.config.js was trying to merge configs that weren't compatible with your Expo setup

## Current Status

✅ **metro.config.js** - Fixed to use only Expo's config
✅ **Port 8081** - Scripts clear it automatically
✅ **Caches** - Scripts clear them automatically
✅ **Dev Server** - Ready to start

## Verify It Works

1. Run:
   ```bash
   ./simple-start.sh
   ```

2. When the server starts:
   - Press `i` to run on iOS
   - The app should load without errors

3. If you see the app running, everything is fixed!

## If You Still Get Errors

### Error: Module not found
Install the package:
```bash
npm install @react-native/metro-config --save-dev
```

### Error: Port in use
Kill the port manually:
```bash
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9
```

### Error: Manifest loading
The app is already installed and trying to connect. Either:
1. Delete the app from simulator and reinstall
2. Or open the app and shake to configure the bundler URL

## Development Build vs Expo Go

Your app is configured as a **development build** (custom native code), not for Expo Go. This means:
- You need to run `npm run ios` to build and install
- The app connects to Metro bundler at localhost:8081
- You can't use Expo Go app from the App Store

## Working Commands

These commands now work:
```bash
# Start the dev server
./simple-start.sh

# Build and run on iOS
npm run ios

# Start with tunnel (if network issues)
npx expo start --tunnel
```

## Summary

The main issue was the missing `@react-native/metro-config` package. The metro.config.js has been updated to work with just Expo's configuration, which is all you need for your app. Use `./simple-start.sh` to start the development server.

Your app builds successfully (as shown in the logs), it just needed the Metro bundler to be running properly to serve the JavaScript bundle.
