};

const queueOfflineAction = (action) => {
  offlineStore.actions.push({
    id: uuid(),
    action,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  });
  persistQueue();
};

const syncWhenOnline = async () => {
  if (navigator.onLine && offlineStore.actions.length) {
    try {
      await Promise.all(
        offlineStore.actions.map(action => 
          processAction(action)
        )
      );
      offlineStore.actions = [];
      persistQueue();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Sync failed:', error);
    }
  }
};
```

b) Conditional Workflows:
```javascript
const workflowEngine = {
  async execute(workflow, context) {
    for (const step of workflow.steps) {
      if (step.condition) {
        const conditionMet = await evaluateCondition(step.condition, context);
        if (!conditionMet) continue;
      }
      await executeStep(step, context);
    }
  }
};
```

3. Best Practices

a) Performance

4. Potential Challenges

a) Technical Challenges
- Complex state management with offline support
- Race conditions in sync operations
- Battery consumption with background tasks
- Cross-platform compatibility

b) User Experience
- Workflow complexity vs usability
- Clear error messaging
- Performance on lower-end devices
- Learning curve for advanced features

5. Code Example: Integration System

```typescript
// Integration interface
interface Integration {
  id: string;
  type: 'webhook' | 'api' | 'custom';
  config: Record<string, any>;
  execute(params: any): Promise<any>;
}

// Webhook integration implementation
class WebhookIntegration implements Integration {
  id: string;
  type: 'webhook';
  config: {
    url: string;
    method: string;
    headers: Record<string, string>;
  };

  async execute(params: any): Promise<any> {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(this.config.url, {
        method: this.config.method,
        headers: this.config.headers,
        body: JSON.stringify(params)
      });
      
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
      }
      
      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Webhook execution failed:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}

// Integration manager
class IntegrationManager {
  private integrations: Map<string, Integration> = new Map();

  registerIntegration(integration: Integration) {
    this.integrations.set(integration.id, integration);
  }

  async executeIntegration(id: string, params: any): Promise<any> {
    const integration = this.integrations.get(id);
    if (!integration) {
      throw new Error(`Integration ${id} not found`);
    }
    return await integration.execute(params);
  }
}
```

Implementation Strategy:

1. Start with core improvements (offline support)
2. Add integration capabilities
3. Enhance workflow engine
4. Implement advanced features
5. Optimize performance
6. Add security measures

Remember to:
- Test thoroughly
- Document changes
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Get user feedback
- Monitor performance
- Regular security reviews

These improvements should significantly enhance the app's capabilities while maintaining stability and user experience.

## ChatGPT Insights

To enhance the Zaptap mobile automation app, we can explore a variety of new feature ideas and improvements. Below are some specific suggestions along with approaches, best practices, challenges, and some illustrative code examples.

### 1. Voice Command Integration

**Improvement Suggestion:**  
Introduce voice command capabilities to trigger automation workflows. This would make the app more accessible and hands-free, enhancing user experience.

**Implementation Approaches:**  
- Utilize libraries like `react-native-voice` for voice recognition.
- Integrate with AI services like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, or Appleâ€™s Siri for voice command processing.

**Best Practices:**  
- Ensure commands are intuitive and simple.
- Provide feedback to the user after a command is processed.
- Include a training mode to help users understand available commands.

**Potential Challenges:**  
- Ensuring accurate voice recognition in noisy environments.
- Supporting multiple languages and accents.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
import Voice from '@react-native-voice/voice';

Voice.onSpeechResults = this.onSpeechResults;

onSpeechResults = (e) => {
  const command = e.value[0];
  if (command.includes('start workflow')) {
    this.startWorkflow();
  }
};

startListening = async () => {
  try {
    await Voice.start('en-US');
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
};
```

### 2. Enhanced NFC Capabilities

```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const saveWorkflow = async (workflow) => {
  try {
    await AsyncStorage.setItem('@workflow', JSON.stringify(workflow));
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
};

const loadWorkflow = async () => {
  try {
    const jsonValue = await AsyncStorage.getItem('@workflow');
    return jsonValue != null ? JSON.parse(jsonValue) : null;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
};
```

### 5. Integration with IoT Devices

**Improvement Suggestion:**  
Enable interactions with IoT devices, allowing automation workflows to trigger actions on smart home devices.
