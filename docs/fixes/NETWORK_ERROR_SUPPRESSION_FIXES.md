# Network Error Suppression & Console Cleanup Fixes

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive network error suppression and console cleanup to eliminate error spam when offline or experiencing network issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Network Error Logging in baseApi.ts âœ…
**Problem**: Network errors were being logged at ERROR level causing console spam
**Solution**: 
- Modified error logging in `enhancedBaseQuery` to detect network errors
- Network errors now logged as info messages with ðŸ“´ emoji
- Added detection for `NetworkError`, `AuthRetryableFetchError`, and "Network request failed"
- Applied same logic to RPC query functions

### 2. AuthRetryableFetchError Handling âœ…
**Problem**: This specific error type wasn't being caught consistently
**Solution**: 
- Already handled in previous fixes in AuthInitializer and client.ts
- Added to baseApi.ts error detection patterns
- Network errors during auth operations are now gracefully handled

### 3. App Double-Loading Prevention âœ…
**Problem**: Console logs showed app initializing twice
**Solution**: 
- Added global `appInitialized` flag to prevent double initialization
- Added `renderCount` to track app renders
- Removed verbose render logging (SafeAreaProvider rendered, etc.)
- Console logs now only appear on first initialization

### 4. Expo Dev URL Deep Link Warnings âœ…
**Problem**: Expo development URLs were triggering invalid deep link warnings
**Solution**: 
- Modified LinkingService to detect and ignore Expo dev URLs
- Added checks for `expo-development-client` and `exp+zaptap://` patterns
- Expo dev URLs no longer logged as deep links or warnings

### 5. Global Error Interceptor âœ…
**Problem**: Various libraries might log network errors directly
**Solution**: 
- Created `errorInterceptor.ts` with console.error override
- Filters network-related errors automatically
- Includes debouncing to prevent duplicate errors
- Network errors logged as info instead of errors
- Initialized at app startup

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **src/store/api/baseApi.ts**
   - Updated console.error calls to check for network errors
   - Network errors logged as info, not errors

2. **App.tsx**
   - Added initialization flags to prevent double loading
   - Removed verbose provider logging
   - Added error interceptor initialization

3. **src/services/linking/LinkingService.ts**
   - Added Expo dev URL detection
   - Suppressed warnings for development URLs

4. **src/utils/errorInterceptor.ts** (NEW)
   - Global console.error interceptor
   - Network error pattern detection
   - Debouncing for duplicate errors

### Network Error Patterns Filtered:
- Network request failed
- Failed to fetch
- NetworkError
- AuthRetryableFetchError
- fetch failed
- ERR_NETWORK
- ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED
- ECONNREFUSED
- ETIMEDOUT
- Unable to resolve host
- Network is unreachable

## Expected Results
- No more ERROR level logs for network failures
- Clean console output when offline
- No duplicate initialization logs
- No Expo development URL warnings
- Network issues shown as info messages with ðŸ“´ emoji

## Testing
1. Turn off network/airplane mode
2. Open the app - should see minimal ðŸ“´ network unavailable messages
3. No ERROR logs for network issues
4. Sign in functionality preserved when coming back online
