## **ðŸš¨ If Issues Found**

If any of these tests fail, please:

1. **Check the file paths** - ensure changes were applied correctly
2. **Restart the app** - some changes may require a fresh app restart
3. **Clear cache** - try clearing Metro cache: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
4. **Check imports** - verify all required imports are present

## **ðŸ“± Device Testing**

Test on both:
- **iOS devices/simulator**
- **Android devices/emulator**

The Material Design components should work consistently across platforms.
