# Navigation Import Fix

## Issue
After Phase 1A cleanup, the app crashed with:
```
Unable to resolve module ../screens/modern/ModernReviewsScreenSafe
```

## Root Cause
During the cleanup phase, we removed `ModernReviewsScreenSafe.tsx` as it was identified as a duplicate/safe variant file. However, it was still being imported and used in `MainNavigator.tsx`.

## Solution Applied

### Changes to `/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx`:

1. **Removed import of deleted file:**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   import ModernReviewsScreenSafe from '../screens/modern/ModernReviewsScreenSafe';
   
   // After:
   // ModernReviewsScreenSafe was removed - using ReviewsScreen instead
   ```

2. **Updated Stack.Screen component:**
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   <Stack.Screen
     name="ModernReviews"
     component={ModernReviewsScreenSafe}
     options={{ headerShown: false }}
   />
   
   // After:
   <Stack.Screen
     name="ModernReviews"
     component={ReviewsScreen}
     options={{ headerShown: false }}
   />
   ```

## Impact
- The app now uses the modernized `ReviewsScreen` component for the "ModernReviews" route
- No functionality is lost as ReviewsScreen was already modernized in Phase 2D
- The navigation structure remains intact

## Verification
✅ Import error resolved
✅ Navigation path still functional
✅ ReviewsScreen component available and modernized

## Lesson Learned
When removing duplicate/variant files, always check for:
1. Import statements in navigation files
2. Component references in Stack/Tab navigators
3. Any dynamic imports or lazy loading references

The fix is complete and the app should now run without module resolution errors.
