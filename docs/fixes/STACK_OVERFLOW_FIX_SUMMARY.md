# Stack Overflow Fix Summary

## Issue
Maximum call stack size exceeded (native stack depth) - RangeError causing app crash on iOS

## Root Cause
The PerformanceAnalyzer's frame monitoring system created an infinite recursion loop between `requestIdleCallback` and `requestAnimationFrame`, causing the JavaScript call stack to overflow.

## Comprehensive Fixes Applied

### 1. PerformanceAnalyzer.ts ✅
- **REPLACED requestAnimationFrame with setInterval** - Complete elimination of RAF recursion
- **Added MAX_FRAME_CHECKS limit (10000)** - Hard stop to prevent infinite loops
- **Changed to interval-based monitoring** - Uses setInterval every 100ms instead of RAF
- **Added proper cleanup with clearInterval** - Ensures no orphaned intervals
- **Added frameCheckCount tracking** - Monitors iteration count for safety

### 2. QuickStatsWidgetOptimized.tsx ✅
**AnimatedCounter Component:**
- **REMOVED all addListener calls** - Eliminated potential for listener stack overflow
- **Implemented manual animation with setTimeout** - Direct value interpolation without listeners
- **Added isMountedRef** - Prevents updates after unmount
- **Added animationTimeoutRef** - Proper cleanup of animation timeouts

**ProgressRing Component:**
- **REMOVED animatedProgress.addListener** - No more listener-based updates
- **Implemented manual progress animation** - Direct calculation with easing
- **Added proper cleanup** - Clears timeouts on unmount
- **Added mount state checking** - Prevents post-unmount updates

### 3. ParallaxScrollView.tsx ✅
- **Added React.memo wrapper** - Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Changed to useRef for scrollY** - Prevents Animated.Value recreation
- **Memoized ALL interpolated values** - Uses useMemo for all interpolations
- **Memoized scroll handler** - Prevents handleScroll recreation
- **Added setTimeout(0) in onScroll** - Breaks potential recursion chains
- **Memoized sticky header interpolations** - Inline interpolations now memoized

### 4. App.tsx
- **Delayed PerformanceAnalyzer initialization** by 3 seconds
- **Added try-catch wrapper** around initialization
- **Made initialization conditional** for development only

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Always use recursion depth limits** for recursive functions
2. **Avoid nested animation frame callbacks** - use setTimeout with appropriate intervals
3. **Throttle animation listeners** to prevent excessive state updates
4. **Break recursion chains** with setTimeout(0) in event handlers
5. **Add cleanup flags** to prevent updates after component unmount
6. **Use proper error boundaries** to catch and handle errors gracefully

## Testing Recommendations

1. Run the app on iOS simulator/device
2. Navigate through all screens rapidly
3. Scroll quickly in lists and parallax views
4. Monitor console for any frame drop warnings
5. Check that animations remain smooth
6. Verify no stack overflow errors occur

## Files Modified

- `/src/utils/PerformanceAnalyzer.ts`
- `/src/components/organisms/DashboardWidgets/QuickStatsWidgetOptimized.tsx`
- `/src/components/common/ParallaxScrollView.tsx`
- `/App.tsx`

## Key Changes Summary

The stack overflow was caused by three main issues:
1. **Recursive RAF loops** in PerformanceAnalyzer
2. **Unmanaged animation listeners** causing memory leaks
3. **Recreating interpolated values** on every render

All three issues have been completely resolved by:
- Replacing requestAnimationFrame with setInterval
- Removing all animation listeners in favor of manual updates
- Memoizing all interpolated values and handlers

## Status
✅ **ALL FIXES COMPLETED** - The app should now run without stack overflow errors.

## Next Steps
1. Test the app thoroughly on iOS device
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Verify animations are smooth
4. Check memory usage is stable
