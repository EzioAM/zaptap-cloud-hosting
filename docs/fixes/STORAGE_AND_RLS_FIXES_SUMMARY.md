# Storage and RLS Fixes Summary
**Date**: January 8, 2025  
**Issues Fixed**: AsyncStorage overflow & RLS policy violations

## üéØ Problems Solved

### 1. AsyncStorage "Row too big" Error
**Issue**: CrashReporter failed with "Row too big to fit into CursorWindow" error due to accumulated offline data (348 metrics, multiple crash reports).

**Root Cause**: 
- No size limits on offline storage
- Data accumulated indefinitely
- AsyncStorage/SQLite has cursor window size limits

**Solution**:
- Added size limits: 100 metrics, 50 alerts, 50 reports
- Implemented 24-hour retention for metrics
- Added size checks before storage (200-250KB limits)
- Created cleanup methods for oversized data

### 2. RLS Policy Violations (Error 42501)
**Issue**: Monitoring services couldn't insert data - "new row violates row-level security policy"

**Root Cause**:
- Tables had RLS policies requiring authentication
- Monitoring starts before user authentication
- Anonymous role had no insert permissions

**Solution**:
- Added anonymous insert policies for both tables
- Maintained read security for authenticated users
- Documented why anonymous access is needed

## üìÅ Files Modified

### 1. **CrashReporter.ts**
```typescript
// Added:
- clearOversizedOfflineData() method
- Row too big error handling in loadOfflineReports()
- Reduced limits: 50 reports max, 250KB size limit
- Size checks before storing
```

### 2. **PerformanceMonitor.ts**
```typescript
// Added:
- clearOversizedOfflineData() method  
- Row too big error handling in loadOfflineData()
- 24-hour retention for metrics
- Reduced limits: 100 metrics, 50 alerts
- Size checks: 200KB for metrics, 150KB for alerts
```

### 3. **setup-monitoring-tables.sql**
```sql
-- Added policies:
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert performance metrics" 
  ON performance_metrics FOR INSERT TO anon WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous insert error reports"
  ON error_reports FOR INSERT TO anon WITH CHECK (true);
```

### 4. **New Scripts Created**
- `scripts/cleanup-offline-data.js` - Manual cleanup utility
- `scripts/verify-storage-fixes.js` - Verification script

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Run SQL Script in Supabase
```sql
-- Copy contents of scripts/setup-monitoring-tables.sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### Step 2: Clear Existing Oversized Data (Optional)
```bash
# If you still have oversized data issues
node scripts/cleanup-offline-data.js

# Or add this to your app:
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

async function clearMonitoringData() {
  await AsyncStorage.multiRemove([
    'performance_metrics_offline',
    'performance_alerts_offline',
    'crash_reports_offline'
  ]);
}
```

### Step 3: Restart App
```bash
npm start
# Monitoring should now work without errors
```

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior After Fixes

### With Database Tables:
- ‚úÖ Monitoring data inserts successfully
- ‚úÖ No RLS policy violations
- ‚úÖ Anonymous users can submit metrics/reports
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users can read all data

### Without Database Tables:
- ‚úÖ Services detect missing tables specifically
- ‚úÖ Clear error message with setup instructions
- ‚úÖ Data stored offline with size limits
- ‚úÖ No cursor overflow errors

### Data Management:
- ‚úÖ Old metrics auto-cleaned after 24 hours
- ‚úÖ Storage limits prevent overflow
- ‚úÖ Graceful handling of oversized data
- ‚úÖ Automatic recovery when size issues occur

## üìä Storage Limits Summary

| Data Type | Max Items | Max Size | Retention |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Metrics | 100 | 200KB | 24 hours |
| Alerts | 50 | 150KB | Unlimited |
| Reports | 50 | 250KB | Unlimited |

## üîç Verification

Run verification script to confirm all fixes:
```bash
node scripts/verify-storage-fixes.js

# Expected output:
‚úÖ All fixes have been successfully applied!
```

## üéâ Results

### Before Fixes:
- ‚ùå "Row too big" errors preventing app startup
- ‚ùå RLS violations blocking all monitoring
- ‚ùå Unlimited data accumulation
- ‚ùå No cleanup mechanisms

### After Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Smooth app startup
- ‚úÖ Monitoring works with or without auth
- ‚úÖ Automatic data cleanup
- ‚úÖ Size-limited storage
- ‚úÖ Graceful error recovery

## üìù MVP Status Update

With these fixes complete, the monitoring infrastructure is now stable and production-ready. This was a critical blocker that has been resolved, allowing the project to continue toward the February 2025 launch target.

### Next Priorities:
1. Complete Phase 4 micro-interactions (30% done)
2. Begin Phase 5 visual polish
3. Performance optimization
4. Beta testing preparation

The app is **65% complete** overall and on track for launch.

## üîß Technical Notes

### Why Anonymous Access?
1. **App initialization**: Monitoring starts before authentication
2. **Crash reporting**: Must capture crashes even when logged out
3. **Background monitoring**: Services run regardless of auth state

### Why Size Limits?
1. **AsyncStorage limitations**: SQLite cursor window has size limits
2. **Performance**: Large data slows down app startup
3. **Memory usage**: Prevents excessive memory consumption
4. **Network efficiency**: Smaller batches for syncing

### Retention Strategy:
- **Metrics**: 24-hour retention (high volume, less critical)
- **Alerts & Reports**: Longer retention (low volume, more critical)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If errors persist:
1. Verify tables exist in Supabase
2. Check environment variables (.env file)
3. Clear app data and restart
4. Run cleanup script manually

### Common Issues:
- **Still getting RLS errors**: Run the updated SQL script
- **Still getting size errors**: Run cleanup script
- **Tables not found**: Create tables with SQL script
- **No Supabase connection**: Check .env configuration
