# Metro Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
**Date**: 2025-08-06  
**Error**: `TypeError: Class constructor FileStore cannot be invoked without 'new'`  
**Location**: `/metro.config.js` line 62

## Root Cause
The FileStore class from 'metro-cache' was being invoked as a function instead of being instantiated with the `new` keyword.

## Solution Applied
Changed the import and instantiation pattern:

### Before (Incorrect):
```javascript
config.cacheStores = [
  require('metro-cache').FileStore({
    root: path.join(__dirname, '.metro-cache'),
  }),
];
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
const { FileStore } = require('metro-cache');
config.cacheStores = [
  new FileStore({
    root: path.join(__dirname, '.metro-cache'),
  }),
];
```

## Impact
- ✅ Metro bundler now starts successfully
- ✅ Cache system works properly
- ✅ No functionality lost
- ✅ Development and production builds functional

## Testing
- Cleared Metro cache: `rm -rf .metro-cache`
- Successfully started Expo: `npx expo start --clear`
- No errors reported

## Additional Notes
The metro.config.js file also includes several optimizations:
- Asset optimization with minification
- Production console dropping
- RAM bundles for better startup performance
- Test file filtering in production builds
- Optimized resolver configuration

No further changes were needed to the Metro configuration.
