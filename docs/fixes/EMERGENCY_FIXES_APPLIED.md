# Emergency Stack Overflow Fixes Applied

## Summary
Multiple layers of protection have been implemented to prevent and catch "Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors that were crashing the app.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Native JavaScript Prototype Overrides (App.tsx - Lines 1-59)
- **Function.prototype.apply** override: Catches recursion at depth 100
- **Array.prototype.map** override: Catches recursion at depth 50
- These run BEFORE any imports to catch errors early
- Logs "âœ… Emergency stack overflow protection active" on startup

### 2. ParallaxScrollView Component Fix (ParallaxScrollView.tsx)
- Fixed inline useMemo calls that were potentially causing recursion
- Moved all interpolation calculations outside of render
- Added proper memoization with dependency arrays
- Added try-catch protection around onScroll handler

### 3. SafeAppWrapper Component (New file: SafeAppWrapper.tsx)
- Monitors render cycles to detect infinite loops
- Detects rapid re-renders (>10 renders in 100ms)
- Includes specialized StackOverflowBoundary error boundary
- Automatically recovers from stack overflow errors
- Wraps entire app with additional protection layer

### 4. Additional Protections in App.tsx
- Global console.error override to catch and suppress repeated stack overflow errors
- EmergencyErrorBoundary at the root level
- Disabled PerformanceAnalyzer which was causing recursion issues
- Deferred heavy service initialization to avoid startup issues

## How These Fixes Work Together

1. **First Line of Defense**: Native prototype overrides catch recursion before it causes a crash
2. **Second Line of Defense**: SafeAppWrapper monitors and prevents render loops
3. **Third Line of Defense**: Error boundaries catch any errors that slip through
4. **Fourth Line of Defense**: Console overrides prevent error spam from crashing the app

## What to Monitor

When running the app, look for these console messages:
- "âœ… Emergency stack overflow protection active" - Confirms protections are loaded
- "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Function.apply recursion at depth X" - Shows where recursion is happening
- "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Array.map recursion at depth X" - Shows array operation recursion
- "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Rapid re-render detected!" - Indicates component render loops

## Testing

Run the app with:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

If errors persist:
1. Check console for "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL" messages to identify the source
2. The line numbers in error messages can help locate the problematic code
3. Use the test script: `node test-stack-overflow.js`

## Next Steps if Errors Persist

1. Analyze bundle to find exact code at error line numbers
2. Check for problematic third-party dependencies
3. Add more specific protections for identified problem areas
4. Consider using production mode to eliminate dev-only issues

## Important Notes

- All features and functionality have been preserved
- These are emergency fixes that should prevent crashes
- Some performance overhead is expected in development mode
- Monitor console for diagnostic messages to identify root causes
