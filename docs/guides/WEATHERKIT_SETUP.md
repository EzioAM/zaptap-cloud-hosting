# WeatherKit Setup Instructions

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps
1. **WeatherKit native module created** - Swift and Objective-C bridge files
2. **WeatherKit capability added** - In app entitlements
3. **WeatherKit key created** - You have the .p8 file from Apple Developer

## üìù Next Steps to Enable Real Weather

### Option 1: Production Setup (Recommended)
Set up a server endpoint (e.g., Supabase Edge Function) to generate JWT tokens:

1. Store your `.p8` key securely on your server
2. Create an endpoint that generates WeatherKit JWT tokens
3. Update `WeatherKitService.ts` to fetch tokens from your server
4. The native module will use these tokens to authenticate with Apple

### Option 2: Development Testing
For immediate testing in development:

1. **Update the config file**: `ios/Zaptap/WeatherKitConfig.swift`
   - Replace `YOUR_KEY_ID_HERE` with your actual WeatherKit Key ID
   - Replace `YOUR_P8_KEY_CONTENTS_HERE` with the contents of your .p8 file
   
2. **Find your Key ID**:
   - Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)
   - Navigate to Keys
   - Find your WeatherKit key
   - Copy the Key ID (it looks like: `ABC123DEF4`)

3. **Add your private key**:
   - Open your downloaded `.p8` file in a text editor
   - Copy the entire contents (including BEGIN/END lines)
   - Paste into the `privateKey` variable in `WeatherKitConfig.swift`

4. **Update the native module** to use the config (optional for now)

5. **Rebuild the app**:
   ```bash
   cd ios && pod install
   cd .. && npm run ios
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning
- **NEVER commit** `WeatherKitConfig.swift` to version control
- The file is already added to `.gitignore`
- For production apps, always use server-side JWT generation
- The private key should never be in your client app in production

## üîç Current Status
- WeatherKit module is detected ‚úÖ
- Fallback to simulated weather is working ‚úÖ
- Real weather requires JWT authentication setup (pending)

## üéØ Testing
Once configured, the app will:
1. Detect iOS 16+ devices
2. Generate/fetch JWT token
3. Call WeatherKit API with real location
4. Display actual weather conditions with live animations

For now, the simulated weather provides a good development experience with all visual effects working.
