# Quick iPhone Testing Guide

## ✅ What's Working Now

Your development environment is set up and the app can run! The Metro bundler started successfully, which means:
- Node.js 18 is working correctly
- All dependencies are installed properly
- The app configuration is valid

## 🚀 Test on Your iPhone Right Now

### Step 1: Install Expo Go
1. Open the App Store on your iPhone
2. Search for "Expo Go" 
3. Install the free Expo Go app

### Step 2: Start the Development Server
In your terminal (make sure you're in the ShortcutsLike directory):
```bash
npx expo start
```

### Step 3: Connect Your iPhone
1. Make sure your iPhone and Mac are on the same WiFi network
2. A QR code will appear in your terminal
3. Open the Camera app on your iPhone
4. Point it at the QR code in the terminal
5. Tap the notification that appears
6. The app will open in Expo Go

## 🎯 What You Can Test

With Expo Go, you can test:
- ✅ Basic app functionality
- ✅ Navigation
- ✅ UI components
- ✅ Redux state management
- ✅ Camera (for QR scanning)
- ✅ Location services
- ❌ NFC features (requires development build)

## 🔄 Hot Reload

Once connected:
- Make changes to your code
- Save files
- The app automatically reloads on your iPhone
- Perfect for rapid development!

## 🛠️ Development Build (For NFC)

For the full experience with NFC features, we'll need to:
1. Create an Expo account at https://expo.dev
2. Configure the EAS project properly
3. Build a development build

But for now, you can start developing and testing most features immediately with Expo Go!

## 🚨 If You Have Issues

### Network Problems
If the QR code doesn't work:
1. In terminal, look for the URL (usually `exp://192.168.1.xxx:8081`)
2. Type this URL manually in Expo Go

### Can't Connect
1. Make sure both devices are on the same WiFi
2. Check your Mac's firewall settings
3. Try: `npx expo start --tunnel` (slower but works through any network)

## Next Steps

1. **Test basic functionality** with Expo Go
2. **Make some changes** to see hot reload in action
3. **Plan NFC features** for later development build
4. **Iterate quickly** on UI and core features

You're ready to start developing! 🎉
