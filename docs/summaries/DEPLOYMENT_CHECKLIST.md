## **üîÑ Deployment Process**

### **Step 1: Backup Current State**
- [ ] Tag current production code: `git tag pre-crash-fix-$(date +%Y%m%d)`
- [ ] Document current crash rates/metrics
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan if needed

### **Step 2: Staged Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
- [ ] Run full test suite on staging
- [ ] Monitor staging for 2+ hours
- [ ] Get stakeholder approval

### **Step 3: Production Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy during low-traffic window
- [ ] Monitor error rates in real-time
- [ ] Have rollback ready within 15 minutes
- [ ] Notify team of deployment status

### **Rollback Process**:
1. **Stop deployment immediately**
2. **Revert to tagged pre-fix version**
3. **Notify team and stakeholders**
4. **Document issues encountered**
5. **Plan fix strategy for next iteration**
