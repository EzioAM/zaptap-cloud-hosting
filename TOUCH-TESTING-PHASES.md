# Touch Testing Phases

## Current Phase: 6 - Testing SafeAreaProvider

To test different phases, swap the appropriate file to App.tsx:

```bash
# Phase 5 (CONFIRMED WORKING)
cp App-Phase5-Working.tsx App.tsx

# Phase 6 (Current)
# Already active in App.tsx

# Phase 7 
cp App-Phase7-Redux.tsx App.tsx

# Phase 8
cp App-Phase8-Paper.tsx App.tsx

# Phase 9
cp App-Phase9-Navigator.tsx App.tsx

# Full App
cp App-Full.tsx App.tsx
```

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 5 âœ… WORKING
- GestureHandlerRootView
- NavigationContainer  
- WelcomeScreen

### Phase 6 (Testing Now)
- **+ SafeAreaProvider**

### Phase 7 
- + Redux Provider

### Phase 8
- + Paper Provider (Material UI)

### Phase 9
- Replace WelcomeScreen with AppNavigator

### Full App
- + All other providers (Theme, Auth, Analytics, etc.)
- + Background services
- + Performance monitoring

## What We're Looking For

The component that causes touches to stop working is the one that blocks the responder chain. Once we identify it, we can:
1. Fix its configuration
2. Replace it with an alternative
3. Remove it if not essential

## Emergency Fallback

If touches break at any phase:
```bash
cp App-Phase5-Working.tsx App.tsx
```

This restores the last known working configuration.
