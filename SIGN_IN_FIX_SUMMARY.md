# Sign-In Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Navigation Import Issue**
- **Problem**: `SignInScreen` was imported as a named export in `BottomTabNavigator.tsx` but it's exported as default
- **Fix**: Changed `import { SignInScreen }` to `import SignInScreen`

### 2. **Missing Navigation Routes**
- **Problem**: SignIn and SignUp screens were not included in the MainNavigator stack
- **Fix**: Added both screens to MainNavigator so they can be navigated to from anywhere

### 3. **Wrong Navigation Target**
- **Problem**: BuildScreen was navigating to 'Profile' instead of 'SignIn' when authentication required
- **Fix**: Changed `navigation.navigate('Profile')` to `navigation.navigate('SignIn')`

## Files Modified

1. `/src/navigation/BottomTabNavigator.tsx` - Fixed import statement
2. `/src/navigation/MainNavigator.tsx` - Added SignIn/SignUp screens to stack
3. `/src/screens/modern/BuildScreen.tsx` - Fixed navigation target

## Testing the Fix

To test if sign-in is working:

```bash
# Run the authentication flow test
npm run test:auth-flow
```

## Manual Testing Steps

1. Open the app
2. Go to Profile tab
3. Tap "Sign In" button - should now navigate to sign-in screen
4. Enter credentials and sign in
5. Try to save an automation - should work if authenticated

## Common Sign-In Issues

1. **Invalid email format**: Supabase may reject certain email formats
2. **No user profile**: User profile is created on first sign-in
3. **JWT expired**: Clear app cache and sign in again
4. **Network issues**: Check internet connection

## Creating a Test Account

In Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication â†’ Users
2. Click "Add user"
3. Create a user with:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `test123`

Or use the app's Sign Up screen to create a new account.

## Next Steps

If sign-in still doesn't work:
1. Check Supabase Auth settings in dashboard
2. Verify email confirmation is disabled for testing
3. Check if RLS policies are blocking user creation
4. Review console logs for specific error messages
