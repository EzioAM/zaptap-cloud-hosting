# Authentication & Database Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **API Error Handling**
- Updated `automationApi.ts` to properly return errors instead of empty arrays
- Errors now properly propagate to UI components for better user feedback
- Fixed error handling in `getPublicAutomations` and `getMyAutomations` queries

### 2. **Loading State Timeouts**
- Added 5-second timeout to prevent infinite loading states in DiscoverScreen
- Loading state properly transitions to error state after timeout
- Added retry functionality with timeout reset

### 3. **Navigation Configuration**
- Verified SignIn and SignUp screens are properly registered in `MainNavigator.tsx`
- Navigation types are correctly defined in `types.ts`
- No navigation issues found - screens are properly accessible

### 4. **Environment Configuration**
- Verified `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
- Verified `app.config.js` properly loads environment variables
- Supabase client is correctly configured with retry logic

### 5. **Connection Context**
- Connection monitoring is properly implemented
- Network state changes trigger connection checks
- Auth state changes update connection status

### 6. **Authentication Flow**
- AuthInitializer properly handles session restoration
- Session refresh logic is implemented
- Sign out properly clears local state

## Testing Scripts Created

### 1. **verify-database.mjs**
- Verifies all required tables exist
- Tests authentication service
- Checks public automations query
- Located at: `/scripts/verify-database.mjs`

### 2. **test-auth-flow.mjs**
- Tests complete authentication flow (sign up, sign in, sign out)
- Verifies authenticated queries work
- Tests session refresh functionality
- Located at: `/scripts/test-auth-flow.mjs`

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Verify database setup
node scripts/verify-database.mjs

# Test authentication flow
node scripts/test-auth-flow.mjs
```

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Error Handling**: Screens now show appropriate error messages instead of getting stuck
2. **Loading Timeouts**: Prevents infinite loading states with 5-second timeout
3. **Retry Functionality**: Users can retry failed operations
4. **Connection Monitoring**: Real-time connection status with retry options
5. **Proper Error Messages**: Clear feedback for different error states

## Next Steps

1. Run the test scripts to verify database and auth setup
2. Test the app to ensure screens load properly
3. Monitor console for any remaining errors
4. Consider adding more robust error recovery mechanisms if needed

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **"Discovering amazing automations..." stuck**: Now times out after 5 seconds with retry option
- **Sign in button not working**: Navigation is properly configured, should work now
- **No data showing**: Check database connection and run verify-database script
- **Auth errors**: Run test-auth-flow script to diagnose authentication issues
