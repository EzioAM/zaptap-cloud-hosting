# Smart Network Error Management Implementation

## Summary
Revised the error handling approach to be less aggressive - now shows diagnostic information while preventing spam. Network errors are shown with context (which API failed) and summarized after the first few occurrences.

## Key Changes

### 1. Smart Error Interceptor ✅
**Previous**: All network errors were completely suppressed
**New Approach**: 
- Shows first 3 network errors with full context
- Identifies which API endpoint failed (e.g., `[getPublicAutomations]`)
- After 3 errors, suppresses but tracks count
- Shows periodic summaries every 30 seconds
- Logs errors as 🔴 with endpoint context

### 2. Early Error Interceptor Initialization ✅
**Problem**: Network errors were logged before interceptor was ready
**Solution**: 
- Moved error interceptor initialization to the very top of App.tsx
- Now catches errors from the earliest possible point
- Prevents unhandled network errors during app startup

### 3. Duplicate Logging Prevention ✅
**Problem**: App was logging initialization messages multiple times
**Solution**: 
- Added initialization counters to App.tsx, AppNavigator, and MainNavigator
- Logs only show on first render
- Prevents duplicate messages during hot reload/fast refresh

### 4. Expo Dev URL Handling ✅
**Previous**: Expo development URLs triggered "invalid deep link" warnings
**Current**: 
- LinkingService ignores `exp+zaptap://` and `expo-development-client` URLs
- No warnings for development URLs
- Still processes real deep links correctly

## Error Output Example

Instead of completely suppressing errors, you'll now see:

```
🛡️ Error interceptor initialized early
🚨 App.tsx loading...
🚨 App function starting...
🔴 Network Error [getPublicAutomations]: Network request failed
🔴 Network Error [getTrendingAutomations]: Network request failed
🔴 Network Error [auth]: Network request failed
📴 Network errors continuing for getPublicAutomations (13 total)

📊 Network Error Summary (last 30s):
   - getPublicAutomations: 15 errors (3 shown, 12 suppressed)
   - getTrendingAutomations: 10 errors (3 shown, 7 suppressed)
   - auth: 5 errors (3 shown, 2 suppressed)
💡 Check your network connection or API availability
```

## Benefits

1. **Visibility**: Can see which specific APIs are failing
2. **Reduced Spam**: After initial errors, only see summaries
3. **Debugging**: Maintains ability to diagnose network issues
4. **Clean Startup**: No duplicate initialization logs
5. **Context**: Errors show endpoint names for easy identification

## Testing

1. Turn off network/airplane mode
2. Open the app
3. You'll see the first 3 errors for each endpoint
4. After that, periodic summaries show total error counts
5. When network returns, errors should stop

## API Error Context Detection

The error interceptor automatically detects:
- `getPublicAutomations` - Public automation fetching
- `getTrendingAutomations` - Trending content
- `auth` / `session` - Authentication operations
- `RPC function [name]` - Supabase RPC calls
- Generic `network_request_failed` - Other network errors
