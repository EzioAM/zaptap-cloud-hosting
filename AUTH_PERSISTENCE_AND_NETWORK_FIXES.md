# Authentication Persistence & Network Error Fixes

## Summary
Fixed the authentication persistence issue where users had to sign in every time they opened the app, resolved network error spam, fixed Reanimated warnings, and added graceful offline handling.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Not Persisting ✅
**Problem**: Users had to sign in every time they opened the app
**Root Cause**: The `AuthInitializer` component wasn't being used in the app hierarchy
**Solution**: 
- Added `AuthInitializer` to App.tsx to wrap the navigation
- AuthInitializer now properly checks for existing sessions on startup
- Sessions are automatically restored from AsyncStorage
- Expired tokens are refreshed automatically

### 2. Network Request Failures ✅
**Problem**: Continuous network error spam when offline or unable to reach Supabase
**Solution**:
- Created `networkAwareApi.ts` with smart network checking
- API calls are prevented when device is offline
- Errors are debounced to prevent spam (1 minute interval)
- Graceful fallback to empty data when offline

### 3. Reanimated Warnings ✅
**Problem**: "Reading from `value` during component render" warnings
**Root Cause**: Direct access to shared values during render in EnhancedLoadingSkeleton
**Solution**: 
- Fixed interpolate usage to be inside useAnimatedStyle
- Consolidated animation styles into a single animated style

### 4. Connection Context Improvements ✅
**Problem**: useConnection was hardcoded to always return true
**Solution**:
- Re-enabled proper connection checking in DiscoverScreenSafe
- Added proper error logging with debouncing

### 5. Critical ShimmerStyle Reference Error ✅
**Problem**: "Property 'shimmerStyle' doesn't exist" causing app crashes
**Root Cause**: Missed one instance of shimmerStyle when refactoring to shimmerAnimatedStyle
**Solution**: 
- Fixed the remaining reference in the stats variant
- All shimmer animations now use the correct animated style

### 6. AuthRetryableFetchError Handling ✅
**Problem**: Network errors during auth operations were being logged as errors
**Solution**:
- Added network check before attempting session restoration
- Network errors are now logged as info messages, not errors
- Auth state is preserved when offline (no automatic sign out)
- Graceful handling of network failures in refreshSession and ensureValidSession

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **App.tsx** - Added AuthInitializer component
2. **src/store/api/networkAwareApi.ts** - New network-aware utilities
3. **src/store/api/automationApi.ts** - Added network checks to prevent offline API calls
4. **src/screens/modern/DiscoverScreenSafe.tsx** - Fixed hardcoded connection state
5. **src/components/common/EnhancedLoadingSkeleton.tsx** - Fixed Reanimated warnings and shimmerStyle error
6. **src/contexts/ConnectionContext.tsx** - Added error logging with debouncing
7. **src/components/auth/AuthInitializer.tsx** - Added network checks and better error handling
8. **src/services/supabase/client.ts** - Added graceful network error handling in auth helpers

### New Features:
- Network status caching (5-second cache)
- Debounced error logging (1-minute intervals)
- Offline data fallbacks
- Automatic session restoration on app startup

## Testing
The authentication persistence can be tested by:
1. Signing in to the app
2. Completely closing the app (swipe up to remove from memory)
3. Reopening the app - you should remain signed in

## Next Steps
If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check that your device has internet connectivity
2. Verify Supabase credentials in .env file
3. Clear app data/cache if session seems corrupted
