# Supabase Security Migrations

This folder contains security migrations to address issues identified by Supabase Security Advisor.

## Migration Order

Apply these migrations in the following order:

1. **00_comprehensive_security_fix.sql** - Main security fix that addresses all issues:
   - Fixes views exposing auth.users data
   - Removes SECURITY DEFINER from views  
   - Enables Row Level Security (RLS) on all unprotected tables
   - Creates secure access functions
   - Creates private schema for sensitive data

2. **01_fix_auth_users_exposure_dynamic.sql** - Alternative migration if the comprehensive one fails:
   - Dynamically discovers table structure
   - Handles different column naming conventions
   - More verbose logging for debugging

3. **update_developer_role.sql** - Updates marcminott@gmail.com to developer role

## If You Encounter Errors

If you get column-related errors (like "column does not exist"), use the dynamic migration (01) instead of the comprehensive one. It will:
- Automatically detect what columns exist in your tables
- Create views based on the actual table structure
- Log what it finds for debugging

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Views Exposing auth.users
- `change_history` - Now uses secure view with only necessary data
- `user_automation_stats` - Recreated to use public.users instead

### 2. SECURITY DEFINER Views
- All views recreated without SECURITY DEFINER
- Proper RLS policies ensure security instead

### 3. Tables Without RLS
- `user_collections` - RLS enabled with user-specific policies
- `automation_reviews` - RLS enabled with public read, user write
- `audit_logs` - RLS enabled with admin-only access
- `api_keys` - RLS enabled with user-specific policies
- `feature_flags` - RLS enabled with public read, admin write
- `automation_executions` - RLS enabled with owner access
- `step_executions` - RLS enabled with owner access

## Post-Migration Verification

After applying migrations, verify security status in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Security Advisor
2. Check that all issues are resolved
3. Test that the app still functions correctly
