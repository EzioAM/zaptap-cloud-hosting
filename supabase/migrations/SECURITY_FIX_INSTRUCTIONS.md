# Security Fix Instructions

## Overview
This document explains the security fixes and how to apply them to resolve the Supabase linter errors.

## IMPORTANT: Database Schema Discovery
The `change_history` table in your database is for **feature tracking**, not database audit logging. It has columns:
- `user_id` (not `changed_by`)
- `feature`
- `description`
- `status`
- etc.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Column Name Mismatches
The actual schema uses:
- `automations` table: uses `created_by` (not `user_id`)
- `automation_executions` table: uses `user_id`
- `automation_comments` table: uses `user_id`
- `change_history` table: uses `user_id` and tracks feature changes

### 2. Security Issues Resolved
1. **Exposed auth.users**: Views no longer expose auth.users data
2. **SECURITY DEFINER views**: All views recreated without SECURITY DEFINER
3. **Missing RLS**: Enabled RLS on all required tables with appropriate policies

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Choose the Right Migration

We've created several migrations to handle different scenarios:

#### Option 1: Dynamic Security Fix (MOST RECOMMENDED) ⭐
```sql
-- This migration dynamically adapts to your actual database schema
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: 10_dynamic_security_fix.sql
```
This migration will:
- Check each table and column before using them
- Add missing columns when safe (e.g., is_public to user_collections)
- Create policies that match your actual schema
- Provide detailed logging throughout the process
- Never fail due to missing columns

#### Option 2: Check and Fix
```sql
-- This migration checks what exists before applying fixes
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: 09_check_and_fix_security.sql
```
This migration will:
- Check which tables exist
- Check column structures
- Only apply fixes that are needed
- Show detailed logs of what was done

#### Option 3: Minimal Security Fix
```sql
-- This only enables RLS without creating views
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: 08_minimal_security_fix.sql
```
Use this if you just want to enable RLS on the tables.

#### Option 4: Schema-Aware Migration
```sql
-- This handles the actual change_history structure
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: 07_security_fix_actual_schema.sql
```
This migration knows about the feature-tracking `change_history` table but may fail if columns are missing.

### Step 2: Apply the Migration
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy the content of your chosen migration file
3. Run the SQL
4. Check the output logs for any issues

### Step 3: Verify the fixes
After applying the migration, check the Security Advisor in Supabase Dashboard to ensure all issues are resolved.

### Step 4: Test the application
1. Test sign in/out functionality
2. Test viewing automations
3. Test creating/editing automations
4. Test viewing execution history

## Tables with RLS Enabled

The following tables now have Row Level Security enabled:

1. **user_collections** - Users can only access their own collections
2. **automation_reviews** - Public read, authenticated write
3. **feature_flags** - Public read enabled flags, admin write
4. **automation_executions** - Users can only see their own executions
5. **step_executions** - Access through parent execution
6. **shares** - Users can manage their own shares
7. **reviews** - Public read, authenticated write
8. **comments** - Public read, authenticated write
9. **change_history** - Users see their own feature changes, admins see all

## Troubleshooting

### If you get "column does not exist" errors:
**Use migration 10_dynamic_security_fix.sql instead!** This migration dynamically checks for column existence and adapts accordingly. The error you encountered (e.g., "column is_public does not exist") happens when tables exist but have different columns than expected.

### If you get "table already exists" errors:
The migrations use `IF NOT EXISTS` and conditional checks, so this shouldn't happen.

### If RLS policies conflict:
The migrations drop existing policies before creating new ones. Custom policies may need manual review.

### To check what's in your database:
```sql
-- Check table structure
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 'change_history'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check RLS status
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('user_collections', 'automation_reviews', 'feature_flags', 
                  'automation_executions', 'step_executions', 'shares', 
                  'reviews', 'comments', 'change_history');
```

## Next Steps

1. After successful migration, test all app functionality
2. Monitor error logs for any permission issues
3. Consider adding more granular RLS policies based on your app's needs
4. Set up regular security audits using Supabase Security Advisor
